# Lab 1

## Deploying Systems
I was asked to write code to develop and deploy systems. We have a pool of developers and deployers. 
Each system needs to be developed by a developer and deployed by a deployer to multiple environments.

I created the `Developer` and `Deployer` types, picked a random developer to develop each system, and picked
a random deployer to deploy the system to each environment.

Now, I've been asked to support special systems which an only be handled by specialists, The specialists can develop
and deploy systems. So, I created a `Specialist` type that can develop and deploy systems. My code won't compile anymore.

Please help me fix the code. I heard I need to use interfaces for these kinds of things.
